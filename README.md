## 📖 Overview

**Oral AI** is a cutting-edge medical diagnostic ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between patients and early diagnosis. By leveraging a **Multi-Model Deep Learning Pipeline**, the system provides instant, privacy-focused analysis of oral cavity images.

It doesn't just "detect"; it **understands** the difference between a microscopic biopsy slide and a smartphone selfie, routing each to the correct specialist model for maximum accuracy.

---

## 🧠 AI Under the Hood: Architecture

Our system uses a "Smart Triage" architecture to chain three specialized Neural Networks together.

</details>

### 1️⃣ The Triage Gatekeeper (Model C)
*   **Architecture**: **ResNet18** (Transfer Learning)
*   **Role**: The first line of defense. It classifies input images into two distinct categories:
    *   **Clinical**: Standard RGB photos of the oral cavity (teeth, gums, tongue).
    *   **Histopathological**: Microscopic H&E stained biopsy slides.
*   **Why?** This routing mechanism ensures that a microscopic model never sees a selfie, and vice versa, preventing false positives and saving computational resources.

### 2️⃣ The Pathology Expert (Model A)
*   **Architecture**: **Multi-Task DenseNet169** with Custom Heads.
*   **Input**: Histopathological (H&E Stained) Microscope Slides.
*   **Preprocessing (Macenko Normalization)**: Pathology slides vary greatly in color depending on the lab's staining process. We use **Macenko Normalization** to mathematically align the color distribution of every input slide to a "reference" standard before the AI sees it. This makes the model robust to different scanners and staining protocols.
*   **Capabilities (Multi-Head Output)**:
    *   **Tumour vs Non-Tumour (TVNT)**: Binary classification to detect cancer presence.
    *   **Pattern of Invasion (POI)**: Classifies the invasion pattern (5 grades).
    *   **Perineural Invasion (PNI)**: Detects if cancer has invaded nerves.
    *   **Tumour Buds (TB)**: Regression head to count tumour buds (prognostic indicator).
    *   **Mitotic Index (MI)**: Regression head to estimate cell division rate.
    *   **Segmentation**: U-Net style decoder to generate pixel-level heatmaps of the tumour area.

### 3️⃣ The Hygiene Specialist (Model B)
*   **Architecture**: **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once) + **SAHI** (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference).
*   **Input**: Smartphone Photos of the Mouth.
*   **Advanced Inference (Why SAHI?)**: Standard object detection models resize images to low resolutions (e.g., 640x640). In a high-res mouth photo, a small cavity might become just 1-2 pixels after resizing, making it impossible to detect. **SAHI** chops the image into overlapping tiles, runs detection on each tile at full resolution, and then stitches the results back together to detect even the smallest lesions.
*   **Detection Classes**:
    *   `Caries` (Cavities)
    *   `Calculus` (Tartar/Plaque)
    *   `Gingivitis` (Gum Inflammation)
    *   `Ulcers`
    *   `Tooth Discoloration`
    *   `Hypodontia` (Missing Teeth)

## 🤖 AI Chatbot (RAG-Enhanced)

The platform features a context-aware medical assistant powered by **Google Gemini Gemma-3**.

### 🔄 Technical Workflow & API Integration
The chatbot doesn't just "guess"; it uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ground its answers in the model's findings.

1.  **Context Retrieval**:
    *   The system fetches the JSON output from the inference engine (e.g., `{"detected": ["Gingivitis"], "confidence": 0.88}`).
2.  **Prompt Engineering**:
    *   We construct a dynamic prompt that enforces a "Medical Persona".
    *   *Template*:
        ```text
        SYSTEM: You are an empathetic oral health assistant.
        CONTEXT: The user's image analysis shows [Gingivitis] with [High] confidence.
        USER QUERY: {user_input}
        GUARDRAILS: Do not diagnose. Suggest professional care.
        ```
3.  **API Call**:
    *   The constructed prompt is sent to the **Gemini Gemma-3 API** (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`).
    *   The response is streamed back to the frontend, providing an instant, conversational explanation of the visual results.

*   **Example Interaction**:
    *   *User*: "Is this bad?"
    *   *AI (sees Model B detected 'Gingivitis')*: "The analysis detected signs of Gingivitis. While this is common, it indicates gum inflammation. I recommend seeing a dentist for a cleaning..."

## 🚀 Latest Enhancements (v2.0)

We have recently upgraded the platform with professional-grade UI and reporting capabilities:

### 1. High-Fidelity Visual Reporting
The system now ensures that what you see is what you get.
*   **Canvas-to-Image Rendering**: We implemented a client-side engine that renders bounding boxes and confidence labels directly onto a high-resolution canvas.
*   **Annotated Exports**: When a user requests a report, this canvas is converted to a high-quality JPEG and embedded into the PDF and attached to the email. This ensures the doctor/patient sees the exact same detections in the file as they did on the screen.

### 2. Professional Analysis Viewport
The frontend has been redesigned to mimic professional medical imaging software:
*   **Dark Mode Viewport**: Reduces eye strain and improves contrast for identifying lesions.
*   **Glassmorphism Controls**: Floating, semi-transparent controls for toggling heatmaps/detections without obstructing the image.
*   **Fullscreen Inspection**: Users can now expand the analysis view to examine fine details.

### 3. Robust Backend Compatibility
*   **Format Agnostic**: Added intelligent image conversion to handle WebP, PNG, and JPEG uploads seamlessly for PDF generation.
*   **Cross-Platform Support**: Fixed file permission and pathing issues to ensure smooth operation on both Windows (Localhost) and Linux (Docker/Cloud) environments.
